You have woken up in this strange room, No idea what is going!! last thing you remember 
... is being at a bar taking shots and ... its all Fuzzy ... You begin to slowly standup..  

                            Where am I!!?!!!??!!!

Panic sets in, you try your best to control your emotions. You focus on what is around you.
The light is dim, its flickering and feels like it can go out any second... Four concrete Walls and a door.

You approach the door -- You hear a Voice !?! -- "Finally awake i see, I know you have questions, I don't have to give you Answers"

                        "We are going to play a game, where the prize is your life"
